1. what are the main differences between a class component and a functional component?

class component: uses es6 class syntext, has lifecycle methods, and can hold state.
functional component: uses functions , is simpler , and uses hooks like usetate and useeffect


// fuctional
funcion Hello() {
	
return <h1> Hello<h1>; }

//class
class Hello extends React.Component {
	render() {
		return <h1> Hello </h1>;
	}
}

1.2
class compoent: uses ES6 class syntex, has lifecycle methods and can hold state
functional component uses functions is simpler and uses hooks like useState and useeffect

//functional
funciton Hello(){
		return <h1> hello </h1>;
}

//class
class Hello extends React.Component {
	render() {
		return <h1> hello </h1>;
	}
	
}

what are the differences between a class compoentn and a funcitonal component
 class component: uses es6 class syntax, has lifecycle methods, and can hold state.
 funcitonal component: uses functions, is simpler, and uses hooks like useState and useEffect.
 
 // functional
 funciton Hello() {
	return <h1> Hello</h1> 
 }
 
 // class
 class Hello extends React.Component {
	 render() {
		 return <h1> hello </h1>;
	 }
	 
 }

  * Class component: uses ES6 class syntex, has lifecycle methods, and can hold state.
  * Functional Component: Uses functions, is simpler, and uses hookds like useState and useEffect.
  
  //Functional
  function Hello(){
	return <h1> hello </h1>;  
  }
  
  1.5
   // Functional
   function Hello(){
	return <h1> Hello </h1>;   
   }
   
   //Class
   class Hello extends React.Component {
	render(){
		return <h1> hello</h1>;
	}		
   }

    Class component : Uses ES6 class syntax, has lifecycle methods and can hold state
	* Funcitonal Component: Uses funcitons, is simpler, and uses hookds liek useState and useEffect.
	
	// Class
	class Hello extends React.Component {
		render() {
			return <h1> hello </h1>;
		}
	}
