<h2 class="section-heading">Top JavaScript Interview Questions &amp; Answers</h2>
<h3>1. What is the difference between var, let, and const?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <code>var</code> is function-scoped and can be re-declared and updated. <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> are block-scoped. <code>let</code> can be updated but not re-declared. <code>const</code> can neither be updated nor re-declared.</p>
<h3>2. Explain event delegation in JavaScript.</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Event delegation is a technique where a single event listener is added to a parent element to manage events for its children, improving performance and memory usage.</p>
<h3>3. What is the difference between == and ===?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <code>==</code> compares values with type coercion. <code>===</code> compares both value and type strictly.</p>
<h3>4. What is a closure in JavaScript?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when executed outside that scope.</p>
<h3>5. What is the event loop?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The event loop handles asynchronous callbacks in JavaScript, ensuring non-blocking I/O by managing the call stack and callback queue.</p>
<h3>6. What is hoisting?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope.</p>
<h3>7. Explain the concept of promises in JavaScript.</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A promise represents a value which may be available now, or in the future, or never. It has three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.</p>
<h3>8. What is the difference between null and undefined?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <code>null</code> is an assignment value representing no value. <code>undefined</code> means a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value.</p>
<h3>9. What is the purpose of the "use strict" directive?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> It enables strict mode which catches common coding bugs, prevents unsafe actions, and disables features likely to be deprecated.</p>
<h3>10. What are arrow functions?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Arrow functions are a concise syntax for writing functions. They donâ€™t have their own <code>this</code>, <code>arguments</code>, or <code>super</code>, and cannot be used as constructors.</p>
