    <h1>Junior React.js Developer Interview Practice – Ideal Answers</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="question">
      Q: Can you tell me a bit about yourself and your experience with React.js?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      My name is Povilas, and I have over 7 years of experience as a full-stack
      developer, with a focus on React.js and front-end development in recent
      years. From 2019 to 2023, I worked at Allente in Oslo building and
      maintaining React.js applications integrated with ASP.NET MVC,
      collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to deliver key features
      and optimize performance. Prior to that, I gained full-stack experience at
      Rolls-Royce and GNB London, developing internal tools and dashboards using
      JavaScript, PHP, Laravel, Java, and Python. Most recently, until mid-2024,
      I was a Full-Stack Developer and Team Lead at IT Sprendimai MB, where I
      led WordPress development—handling backend (PHP) and frontend (JS, CSS),
      managing the team, conducting code reviews, and building custom themes,
      plugins, and API integrations to enhance performance and scalability.
      Additionally, I worked as a .NET Developer at Tribeca, developing internal
      tools and automation solutions using ASP.NET, Blazor, React.js, and C#,
      and designing SQL database architectures. My broad experience enables me
      to build scalable, efficient web applications while contributing both
      technically and as a team lead.

    <h2>React Fundamentals</h2>

    <div class="question">
      Q1: Can you explain the difference between functional and class components
      in React? When would you use one over the other?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Class components are ES6 classes that extend React.Component and use
      lifecycle methods like <code>componentDidMount</code> and
      <code>componentDidUpdate</code> to manage state and side effects.
      Functional components are simpler functions that return JSX. With the
      introduction of hooks, functional components can now manage state and side
      effects using hooks like <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code>.
      Today, functional components are preferred because they are more concise,
      easier to read, and hooks provide powerful capabilities for managing state
      and lifecycle events without the verbosity of classes.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      Q2: What does the <code>useEffect</code> hook do, and can you give an
      example of how and when you'd use it?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      The <code>useEffect</code> hook lets you perform side effects in
      functional components, such as fetching data, setting up subscriptions, or
      manually changing the DOM. It runs after the render and can be configured
      to run only once on mount or whenever specific dependencies change by
      using the dependency array. Example: Fetch data when the component mounts:

      <pre>
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, []); // empty dependency array means this runs once on mount</pre
      >
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      Q3: What is the difference between <code>useState</code> and
      <code>useRef</code>, and when would you use <code>useRef</code> instead of
      <code>useState</code>?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <code>useState</code> is a hook that manages state in functional
      components and triggers a re-render whenever the state changes.
      <code>useRef</code>, on the other hand, returns a mutable ref object whose
      <code>.current</code> property persists across renders but updating it
      does not trigger a re-render. You use <code>useRef</code> to: - Access or
      store DOM elements (e.g., focusing an input). - Store mutable values that
      don’t affect rendering, like timers or previous values. Example:

      <pre>
const inputRef = useRef(null);

useEffect(() => {
  inputRef.current.focus();
}, []);

return &lt;input ref={inputRef} /&gt;;</pre
      >
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      Q4: Say you have a list of items that the user can add to or remove from.
      How would you manage this list in React? What hooks would you use?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      I would use the <code>useState</code> hook to manage the list as an array.
      To update the list immutably, I would use the spread operator. Example:

      <pre>
const [items, setItems] = useState([]);

// Add an item
const addItem = (newItem) =&gt; {
  setItems(prevItems =&gt; [...prevItems, newItem]);
};

// Remove an item by id
const removeItem = (id) =&gt; {
  setItems(prevItems =&gt; prevItems.filter(item =&gt; item.id !== id));
};</pre
      >
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      Q4.1: Would you consider using <code>useReducer</code> instead of
      <code>useState</code> here? Why or why not?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <code>useReducer</code> is useful when state logic is complex, such as
      when you have multiple related state updates or different types of actions
      that affect the state. It provides a more predictable state management
      pattern similar to Redux reducers. For simple lists,
      <code>useState</code> is sufficient. But if the list logic grows more
      complex, with many actions (add, remove, update, reset), I would consider
      <code>useReducer</code> to better organize the state updates. Example
      reducer:

      <pre>
const reducer = (state, action) =&gt; {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'add':
      return [...state, action.payload];
    case 'remove':
      return state.filter(item =&gt; item.id !== action.payload.id);
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const [items, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, []);</pre
      >
    </div>

    <h2>Behavioral Question</h2>

    <div class="question">
      Q5: Can you describe a challenge you faced in a React project and how you
      solved it?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      In a previous role at Allente, I was tasked with migrating a Blazor
      ASP.NET application to React.js. The migration had to be gradual since the
      React code was injected into ASP.NET <code>.cshtml</code> pages, making it
      a hybrid app rather than a full React SPA. I carefully embedded React
      components within the existing views using
      <code>ReactDOM.render</code> and passed necessary data via model
      properties or global JavaScript objects. A major challenge was ensuring
      smooth data flow and maintaining consistent state between the old and new
      components. I addressed this by writing integration tests, performing
      manual verifications, and collaborating closely with QA. This approach
      minimized disruption and allowed a successful incremental migration to
      React.
