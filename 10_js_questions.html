    <h1>Common JavaScript Interview Questions and Answers</h1>

    <h2>What are the data types in JavaScript?</h2>
    <pre>
Primitive types: String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, BigInt
Non-primitive: Object, Array, Function
  </pre
    >

    <h2>What is the difference between var, let, and const?</h2>
    <pre>
var: Function-scoped, can be redeclared and updated.
let: Block-scoped, can be updated but not redeclared in the same scope.
const: Block-scoped, cannot be updated or redeclared.
  </pre
    >

    <h2>What is a closure?</h2>
    <pre>
A closure is a function that remembers its outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing.
Example:
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    return ++count;
  };
}
const counter = outer();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
  </pre
    >

    <h2>What is the difference between == and ===?</h2>
    <pre>
== checks for value equality with type coercion.
=== checks for both value and type (strict equality).
  </pre
    >

    <h2>What is hoisting in JavaScript?</h2>
    <pre>
Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving declarations to the top of their scope before execution.
Only function and variable declarations are hoisted, not initializations.
  </pre
    >

    <h2>What is the difference between null and undefined?</h2>
    <pre>
null: Intentional absence of value (assigned by developer).
undefined: Variable declared but not assigned a value (default by JS).
  </pre
    >

    <h2>What are arrow functions and how are they different?</h2>
    <pre>
Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for writing functions. They donâ€™t bind their own 'this'.
Example:
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
Difference: No 'this', 'arguments', or 'new' binding.
  </pre
    >

    <h2>What is event bubbling and event capturing?</h2>
    <pre>
Bubbling: Event propagates from child to parent.
Capturing: Event propagates from parent to child.
You can control it using addEventListener(event, handler, useCapture).
  </pre
    >

    <h2>What is the difference between map(), filter(), and reduce()?</h2>
    <pre>
map(): Transforms each element and returns a new array.
filter(): Returns elements that pass a condition.
reduce(): Accumulates array values into a single result.
  </pre
    >

    <h2>Explain 'this' in JavaScript.</h2>
    <pre>
'this' refers to the object from which a function is called. It changes depending on context:
- In global scope: 'this' is window (in browsers).
- Inside object method: 'this' refers to the object.
- In arrow functions: 'this' is lexically inherited.
